Born in February of 1998 and raised in the city of Corinth,Greece.While I was growing up in school I really started loving the field of maths and computer sciences.
I was really fascinated by the idea that such small devices could do so interesting things.With that said, since 2016 I am student at the University Of Thessaly ,
studying Electrical and Computer Engineering.Currently, in my 7th semester my primary interests are data science and programming, but recently the field of economics,
markets and stocks really got my attention.
